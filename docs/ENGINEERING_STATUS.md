# Engineering status

This work pursues accuracy, flexibility, adaptability, and evidence-based
inference across Structor. A passing local regression suite is evidence for the
covered behavior; it does not establish complete recovery of source-level types
or completion of this project-wide objective.

## Requirements and evidence

| Requirement | Verification source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Preserve every observed byte range when generating array candidates | Production `ArrayConstraintBuilder` tests; sparse and overlapping fixture contracts | Eighteen detector cases and seven live layout/diagnostic cases pass |
| Preserve selected array element types when extracting nested subobjects | Residual-fragment helper tests and exact recursive-constructor contracts | Nine helper cases and both live constructor contracts pass; known residual types survive byte-array fallback |
| Use index bounds only where the comparison holds for the same variable value | Fresh-IDB collector tests for branches, short-circuit expressions, mutation, loops, and casts | All 35 combined-plugin cases pass; original collector fails six selected differential cases |
| Distinguish the type of a pointer base from the type of its loaded field | Production access inference helper tests and real `TypeFixer::analyze_variable` calls | Twenty-two focused helper cases and 13 live type-fixer cases pass |
| Preserve full function/variable identity in inference caches | Production composite-key and semantics tests, forced collisions, distinct high addresses/SSA versions, and live ctree extraction | Caller cache and experimental variable identities verified; live extraction emits 19 constraints from 16 expressions |
| Preserve complete type values in lattice caches | Real function/structure hash collisions, mutable child aliases, and returned-result mutation | Directed production lattice tests pass; cache entries own detached snapshots |
| Merge existing types without losing evidence, observed storage, padding, or protected names | Production matcher unit tests and anonymous IDA type checks | Standalone tests and 11 real-IDA checks pass |
| Return solver diagnostics that remain valid after the synthesis context is destroyed | Production solver/optimizer UNSAT tests and public API return/destruction checks | Standalone lifetime checks and public API UNSAT/relaxation checks pass |
| Reject inference results belonging to another function before applying types | Real local/prototype snapshots, foreign/unknown/high-address rejection, and positive application controls | All nine live checks pass within the active IDB |
| Preserve pointer forwarding as address evidence rather than inventing a field load | Alias-only call/comparison negatives and loaded-field positive controls | Live controls pass; original-collector isolation confirms removal of a fictitious linked-list pointer observation |
| Maintain public API, deterministic layouts, transactional persistence, global recovery, vtables, and type fixing | Full licensed integrity suite and external CMake consumer | Commit `496e507` passes all 13 licensed integrity suites (317.7 s); the identity tranche additionally passes targeted live extraction, public API, and external consumer checks |
| Maintain reproducible, usable builds and diagnostics | CMake build, CTest, compile-gated hook checks, explicit `idump` runtime diagnostics | 180 standalone CTest entries pass after identity integration; the release build excludes all eight hook markers and its installed copy passes codesign verification |
| Extend adaptive and interprocedural inference beyond existing supported paths | Production implementation, adversarial fixtures, convergence/resource tests | Incomplete; see remaining work |

## Assumption register

Dependent findings reference these identifiers.

| ID | Assumption | Stress test / falsification probe | Dependent results |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | The local integration target is macOS arm64 with IDA/Hex-Rays 9.4 and an ABI-compatible `idump`. | Load the plugin in a fresh IDB, require actual pseudocode, and compare exact contracts. Repeat on each supported OS, ISA, and SDK before extending the platform claim. | Local runtime and build results only |
| A2 | A reconstructed type describes observed storage; unobserved source declarations are unknown. A regular sparse sequence is a candidate array, not proof of an original array declaration. | Supply incompatible element types, overlapping access widths, missing positions, and explicit element caps. Require the candidate to contain every observed byte and retain competing interpretations. | Array inference |
| A3 | A finite symbolic range requires a condition that dominates the access and still describes the accessed variable value; integer expressions retain their declared width. | Test the opposite branch, a later/prior comparison, disjunction, narrowing, mutation, calls, loop backedges, unstructured entry, high/negative bounds, and wraparound. | Bounded-index expansion |
| A4 | A direct, consistently typed load at offset zero supports one extra pointer level; partial or conflicting views do not identify a unique pointee. | Test scalar loads, pointer loads, callbacks, displaced/nested accesses, narrow reads from larger pointees, and aliases used without loads. | Base-type inference |
| A5 | Existing-type reuse may add information but cannot silently remove observed storage or analyst-protected names. | Reject shrinking/conflicting overlays; verify untouched field types/evidence, padding fragments, array metadata, union/bitfield preservation, and name collisions. | Existing-type merges |
| A6 | Hashes choose cache buckets; equality uses the complete semantic identity. | Use function addresses separated by 2^32 bytes, distinct variable indices, and a deliberately constant hash. | Caller-inference cache |
| A7 | An externally supplied inference result belongs to the current IDB and the same function revision; its full function address must match the application target. | Reject another function, `BADADDR`, and addresses differing above bit 31; verify unchanged local/prototype types and positive same-function writes. IDB identity and stale same-function indices require separate revision tracking. | Type application |
| A8 | Exported diagnostics contain metadata and do not own Z3 expressions tied to an expired context. | Produce real solver and optimizer UNSAT cores, destroy the context, then copy/move/read/destroy the returned diagnostics. Repeat through the public synthesis API. | Diagnostic lifetime |
| A9 | Experimental variable identities are session-local; the ctree stays stable during each extraction pass. Hashes and diagnostic labels are not identities. | Force collisions, vary high address bits/SSA/width/function scope, reuse diagnostic IDs, and recycle node storage between passes. | Experimental extraction and solver variables |
| A10 | Abstract types are finite acyclic trees. Cached keys/results must not retain caller-mutable child aliases; Z3 expressions and external encoders borrow their context. | Mutate the ninth function parameter without changing its hash, mutate a returned cached result, and instantiate multiple encoders in one context. | Lattice cache snapshots and shared sort declarations |

## Changes and reproducibility

Array extents now include missing positions. For example, observed 4-byte loads
at offsets 0, 4, and 12 with stride 4 require
`((12 - 0) / 4) + 1 = 4` elements and `4 * 4 = 16` bytes. The former three-element
candidate covered only `[0, 12)` and excluded the load at offset 12. Checked
integer arithmetic rejects unrepresentable extents; configured caps count
unobserved positions as well as observed elements. [A2]

Conflicting element types retain separate array interpretations. Homogeneous
runs are partitioned by normalized storage type, and unknown observations do
not bridge incompatible runs. Each candidate owns the observation identities
supporting that view; candidate generation and layout coverage use those
identities rather than only offset and width. Reversed observation order is
checked against the same materialized union layout. [A2]

The corrected sparse extent also exposed a subobject-splitting downgrade:
removing the child interval rebuilt a complete residual element from `_QWORD`
storage and discarded the selected unsigned element type. Residuals now retain
that type when their offset and size align with complete source elements and
their previous type is empty or partial. Independently known equal types remain
unchanged. Known pointers,
callbacks, aggregates, scalar interpretations, and array dimensions are not
overwritten by a more generic array. Both recursive-constructor contracts keep
their original unsigned tail-field requirement. [A2]

Type merges stage each accepted overlay before replacing the input. They check
storage conflicts before changing names or moving fields, split intersected
padding, synchronize array metadata, and reserve protected names during
deduplication. Rejected overlays do not reorder or rename the input. Ten initial
regressions failed against the original production implementation; additional
review added protected-name and exact-no-op cases. [A5]

The index collector now controls branch/loop traversal order explicitly. Live
testing exposed two SDK boundary assumptions: the parent list includes a null
root sentinel, and the default visitor enumerates branch/loop bodies before
their conditions. The verified collector handles both, including lowered
sign-bit guards and index postincrements. [A1, A3]

An overlapping-array test exposed a returned diagnostic retaining a Z3 tracking
expression after its context had been destroyed. The public synthesis boundary
now copies metadata only. Weighted Max-SMT also tracks hard assumptions so an
UNSAT result can identify the observations responsible. [A8]

An integer run with a floating-point view of its final element retains both
typed views. When the scalar/union layout wins, `success_relaxed` reports the
unmet aggregate preferences. A live 12-byte example verifies all three
4-byte positions, the two offset-8 views, and all four dropped preference
descriptions; the candidate is not removed merely to make the status read
`success`. [A2, A8]

A full unchanged-HEAD build distinguishes inherited snapshot drift from code
regressions. Six cases produce identical results and pseudocode in that build
and the changed plugin; their runtime baseline is documented in
[`integration_tests/contracts/README.md`](../integration_tests/contracts/README.md).
Collector-only isolation separately proves that a linked-list pointer union
came from comparing an address alias with zero, not from a pointer-typed load.
Both versions preserve the machine-code loop limit omitted by the old snapshot.
The revised collector removes the fictitious field interpretation. [A1, A4]

Type application checks the full function address before capturing or changing
locals, and direct signature application also requires successful inference.
The rejection checks snapshot real local and saved prototype types; positive
controls verify actual same-function writes. [A7]
All seven rejection cases mutate locals or saved signatures with the original
applicator; the two same-function positive controls pass with both versions.

Experimental extraction now analyzes each ctree node inside one function/pass.
Previously its full-function visitor called the single-expression API with a
null function, which returned no constraints. Exact interning includes full
function addresses, SSA versions, memory widths, and expression-node identity;
independent public factory calls remain distinct even when their diagnostic IDs
and labels match. Copies retain identity. Rebuild embedding C++ consumers because
the public object layouts changed, although factory signatures are unchanged.
The integrated live check observes 19 constraints from 16 expressions, and an
external CMake consumer builds successfully. [A1, A9]

Lattice join/meet and encoding caches compare complete types. Directed tests
use two nine-parameter functions with the same bounded hash and a scalar/struct
hash collision. Snapshot tests also mutate shared parameter children after a
cache insertion and mutate cache-hit results; keys and cached values now remain
unchanged. Multiple encoders in one context share its BaseType declaration.
These repairs do not establish lossless compound encoding or complete lattice
algebra; those remain separate work. [A6, A10]

The installed `idump` on the development machine could load the plugin but could
not initialize its own decompiler API. It returned success with assembly-only
output. The fixture harness now reports that condition explicitly. A locally
built IDA 9.4 `idump` produced the exact expected alias-lifetime result and
pseudocode. This is a tool/runtime compatibility observation, not evidence of a
Structor synthesis failure. [A1]

Use an `idump` built for the selected IDA runtime:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DIDA_SDK_DIR=/path/to/idasdk \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DSTRUCTOR_ENABLE_LIVE_TEST_HOOKS=ON
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure --no-tests=error -E '_live$'
python3 integration_tests/check_full_integrity_suite.py \
  --repo-root . --plugin build/structor.dylib --idump /path/to/compatible/idump
```

The integration runners install and codesign temporary plugin copies. Production
builds must exclude live-test hooks. The Linux and Windows plugin suffixes are
`.so` and `.dll`, respectively; local runtime evidence here does not verify those
platforms.

## Algorithm bounds

- Array candidate validation: O(n log n) time and O(n) auxiliary storage for
  n observations, including deterministic ordering of owned evidence. Typed-run
  partitioning takes O(nT + n log n) time for T distinct normalized storage
  types, excluding SDK type-comparison internals. Z3 solve time is bounded by
  its configured timeout, not a polynomial-time guarantee. [A2]
- Direct base-type inference: O(n + d) type operations for n observations and
  d compared pointer levels, with O(1) auxiliary type handles, excluding IDA
  type-object internals. [A4]
- Residual array-type retention: O(1) interval arithmetic and type operations,
  excluding SDK equality and type-construction internals. The source type's
  exact byte extent must match the selected field. [A2]
- Bounded integer evaluation: O(BE) time for E expression nodes and B candidate
  index values, with B limited to 32; O(E) evaluation stack. Guard ancestry and
  cached loop-effect analysis add their own traversal costs. Finite intervals
  enclose possible values; disjoint predicates can leave unreachable values
  inside the interval. This is not a complete path-reachability solver. [A3]
- Existing-type overlay: O(mS + f log f) expected time and O(S) auxiliary storage,
  where m is the number of incoming fields, f is the resulting field count, and
  S includes the copied field/evidence payload. Hash operations assume ordinary
  dispersion. The merge is bounded by `MAX_FIELDS` and `MAX_STRUCT_SIZE`. [A5]
- Caller inference cache: expected O(1) lookup and O(k) entries for k distinct
  function/variable pairs, with full-key comparison on collision. [A6]
- Function identity preflight: O(1) time and space. The existing application
  pipeline retains its own per-variable traversal and propagation costs. [A7]
- Diagnostic export: O(D + L) time and space for D records containing L bytes
  of description text; no solver handles cross the boundary. [A8]
- Exact variable interning: expected O(1) per key, plus O(L) for L name bytes;
  adversarial collisions require O(V) equality checks. Storage is O(V + E + S)
  for persistent keys, current-pass expression nodes, and name bytes. [A9]
- Type-cache snapshots: O(T) time and space for T logical tree nodes. Complete
  equality resolves collisions; caches do not use hashes as type values. [A10]

## Bounded scope expansion and remaining work

- **High impact — experimental type representation:** compound Z3 encoding still
  loses structure IDs and compound details; sum subtyping and join/meet laws need
  directed algebra checks. Memory-result indexing is separate from the repaired
  variable interner. Moving a context with its cached TypeEncoder also needs a
  wrapper-reference repair. The experimental pipeline remains disabled by default.
- **High impact — experimental signature/application mapping:** inspect prototype
  argument mapping through `cfunc_t::argidx`, target ABI selection independent of
  build-host OS, and stale inference across IDB/function revisions. Foreign
  function-address rejection is implemented and live-tested.
- **High impact — provenance:** preserve load versus address-flow evidence and
  independent observation sites across deduplication. Access count alone is not
  a confidence calibration. Local alias maps also need branch-sensitive
  reaching-definition checks; lexical visitation of a sibling branch does not
  establish which pointer value reaches a load.
  A real linked-list witness also shows assignment preorder suppressing the
  right-hand load in `q = *q`; this occurs in both the original and revised
  collector and requires a separate expression-sequencing repair.
- **High impact — interprocedural inference:** the experimental fixed-point API
  remains explicitly unimplemented. Completing it requires convergence,
  recursion/SCC, widening, and resource-bound contracts; a successful local
  layout test cannot verify this requirement.
- **Medium impact — control flow:** lexical guard proofs do not cover general
  dominance, arbitrary goto entry, loop induction, or exact disjoint index sets.
  Finite intervals may overapproximate reachable values; supporting exact path
  predicates requires retaining them through collection and synthesis.
- **Medium impact — validation breadth:** extend live coverage across compiler
  optimization levels, calling conventions, target bitness, and platforms. The
  current local fixture matrix alone cannot establish that breadth.
- **Medium impact — matching completeness:** sparse byte-field matching does not
  yet establish semantic equivalence of whole aggregates or import arbitrary
  bitfield layouts. Preserve those observations until a representable merge is
  established.
- **Medium impact — callee evidence availability:** a local call whose callee has
  not been decompiled may have only scalar placeholder argument types. Pointer
  depth cannot be inferred from source declarations absent from the analyzed
  ctree. Pair unknown-prototype preservation controls with known-prototype
  positives; bounded callee-body inference remains a separate capability.
- **Low impact — artifact hygiene:** fixture compilation rewrites tracked binary
  artifacts. Generated local changes should not obscure source review; migrate
  runners to isolated fixture outputs in subsequent build-system work.

## Quality gates

QG1: no normative or ethical judgment is required. QG2: assumptions and
falsification probes are recorded above. QG3: the requirement table preserves
the full objective and explicitly marks incomplete coverage. QG4: byte offsets,
integer extents, overflow checks, and algorithm bounds are specified. QG5:
adversarial unit and live regressions are required before claiming each repair
verified. QG6: provenance is the production source, original-code regression
runs, and actual build/runtime output; no external claims are inferred from
mock-only tests. QG7: bounded adjacent risks and opportunities are listed above.
Project-wide completion remains unproven.
